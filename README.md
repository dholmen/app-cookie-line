# Add a cookie line to your Enonic XP site!

Telling your users that you use cookies to track them is a mundane task that
just needs to be implemented. A lot of countries require this by law, so it's
nice to be on the safe side.

This application adds a cookie line to your site that you can set up and style
as you like.

## Usage

Using this is pretty straight forward. It will be much easier once it's
available in the [Enonic Market](https://market.enonic.com), but it's still
very doable.

### Step 1: Download the .jar

Get the jar by downloading it from
[bintray](https://bintray.com/artifact/download/selbekk/maven/cookieLine-1.0.0.jar),
or alternatively cloning this repo and building it.

### Step 2: Install the application

Install the application by either copying the `jar`-file to your
`$XP_HOME/deploy` folder, or uploading it via the Applications tab in the
Enonic admin panel.

### Step 3: Add app to your site

In the content manager, select your site and click `edit`. Search for
`Cookie line` in the `Applications` search box, and select it.

### Step 4: Configure

To keep things simple, you don't have to configure a lot. You'll be presented
with four text fields:

- **Design** - Choose the theme of the cookie line - or implement your own
- **Introduction** - A text saying that you're using cookies.
- **Accept button text** - The text on the "okay I got it" button
- **Read more button text** - The text on the "please tell me more" button
- **Read more link** - The page containing more info on your cookie use

## How to style the cookie line

In order for you to have full control of the look-and-feel of the cookie line,
the application provides a "none" design choice. If you want to implement your
own design, please choose this option.

The application adds the following markup to the bottom of your site's
`<body />` tag:

```html
<div class="cookie-line js-cookie-line">
    <div class="cookie-line-inner">
        <p class="cookie-line-intro">{{ intro }}</p>
        <div class="cookie-line-buttons">
            <a class="cookie-line-button mod-accept js-accept-cookies" href="#cookie-line-accept">{{ accept button }}</a>
            <a class="cookie-line-button mod-read-more js-accept-cookies" href="{{ read more link}}">{{Â read more button }}</a>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
```

This structure is designed to give you plenty of flexibility when implementing
your custom styling.

>**Note:** Once the cookie is accepted, the class `is-hidden` is added to
`div.cookie-line`.
